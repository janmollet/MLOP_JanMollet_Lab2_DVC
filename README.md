LAB 2 JAN MOLLET DATA VERSION CONTROL (DVC)

During this lab, I created a bucket in Google Cloud Storage in order to use Data Version Control (DVC) which serves as a technique to save and keep track of different versions of the data.
In this lab, I decided to download a new dataset called "diamonds.csv" from Kaggle to experiment and play around with dvc and visualize how we can add, commit and push datasets to Google cloud to save different versions of the data the same way we do with code when using Github.
